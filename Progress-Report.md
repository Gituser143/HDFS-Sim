Initial Study
==============

* Setup a multi-node hadoop cluster
* Ran mapreduce on the cluster
* Understood the working of HDFS, Block placement and default hadoop policies


Environment Setup
==================

* Finding appropriate simulator to simulate HDFS environment
* Setting up Simulator to work with IDE
* Understood working of simulator and configurations


Devising Algorithm
===================

* Literature survey with appropriate papers to devise Algorithm
* Defined hot and cold zones, new block palcement policy, new block balancer and transfer algorithm
* Visualized algorithm with diagrams and charts


Implementing Algorithm
=======================

* Implemented algorithm on simulator
* Made new modules in simulator to measure power consumption and number of read-write operations  
* Test simulator for accurate functioning


Testing Algorithm
==================

* Ran simulator for multiple hadoop configurations and analyzed difference in energy consumptions
* Edited simulator to work for multipleiterations for various workloads and save data
* Plotted graphs with saved data and verified algorithm accuracy
