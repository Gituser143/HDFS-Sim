Cloud computing has gained rapid popularity from quite some time and it's usage has been quadrupled in the last 4 years. According to a research by Nasuni in 2013 there was just over 1 Exabyte or 1024 Petabytes of data stored in the cloud, and now  Google Cloud Storge alone has about 30 Exabytes of data and While there exists even bigger gaints in the industry like the Amazon Web Services (AWS) , Microsoft Azure and many more equally efficient cloud storage providers like the Alibaba Cloud , IBM Cloud ..etcetera etcetera.. . But what exactly is the cloud storage and processing used for? The clouds currenty provide the resources the data-intensive computing needs which includes advertising optimizations, user interest predictions, mail anti-spam detection and many such similar data analytics it is also currenty being used for live streaming of data which turned out to be of great use for the main reason for the success story of one of the most famous media-services provider, the Netflix.

Most enterprises today are focusing their attention on energy efficient
computing, motivated by high operational costs for their large scale clus-
ters and warehouses. This power related cost includes investment, operating
expenses, cooling costs and environmental impacts.

There is significant amount of research literature about
datacenter energy management. A large number of these
techniques aim to classify and place the computational load
in an energy-efficient manner [6, 14, 16, 17, 19]. They try to
scale-down servers by manufacturing idleness by migrating
workloads and their corresponding state to fewer machines
during periods of low activity. This can be relatively easy to
accomplish when using simple data models, when servers are
mostly stateless (e.g., serving data that resides on a shared
NAS or SAN storage system). However, in complex data
distribution models that have significant state, such tech-
niques cannot manufacture enough idleness to make usage
of inactive power modes feasible. One such example is the
