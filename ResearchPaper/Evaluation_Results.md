Single-Iteration
-----------------

### Total power consumption

This is the total energy consumed for the HDFS simulated with the following configurations.  
- Replication factor hot zone : 3  
- Replication factor cold zone : 2  
- Number of nodes : 100  
- Number of Blocks : 75000  
- Percentage of data going cold : 80%

### Split and comparision of different components of power consumption

- During boot



- First read and first write



- Maintaining the HDFS Infrastructure



- Data transfer between the zones




- Block balancing and continued reads
