We attempt to reduce power consumption in our cluster by reconfiguring its block placement policy for a more qualitative approach suited to the needs of our modified cluster which operates based on zones. Our block placement policy is derived from the default approach and enhanced to work under conditions we have set up for our energy efficient model. Furthermore, our policy is divided into two types: frequent and infrequent transfer.
